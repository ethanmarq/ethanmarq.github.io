Hi, I am Ethan Marquez

I am a student at Clemson University studying Computer Science with a minor in Physics and
Artificial Intelligence.

I have been an undergraduate researcher in the [Machine Learning and Big Data](https://cufctl.github.io/mlbd/)
lab since 2023 under [Dr. Melissa Smith](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/faculty_staff/faculty/msmith.html)
, and am currently also working in the [Pulse Quality & Nutritional Program](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/organic-breeding/index.html)
focusing on machine learning applications to agricultural problems since 2024 under [Dr. Dil Thavarajah](https://www.clemson.edu/health-research/faculty/faculty-scholars/thavarajah.html)

My interests include machine learning, scientific machine learning applications, and computer vision.
I am looking for gaining experience in physics related machine learning as well as high performance
computing.
