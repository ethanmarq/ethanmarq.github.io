Hi, I am Ethan Marquez

I am a student at Clemson University studying Computer Science with a minor in Physics and
Artificial Intelligence.

I am an undergraduate researcher in the [Machine Learning and Big Data](https://cufctl.github.io/mlbd/)
lab since 2023 under [Dr. Melissa Smith](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/faculty_staff/faculty/msmith.html).

I build practical software for machine learning and computational math projects, with strengths in Python and experiment-driven development. I've implemented models in PyTorch and taken graduate coursework in mathematical machine learning, CUDA C/OpenMP, and compression. Recently, I presented research at Supercomputing (SC25) on optimizing computer vision pipelines for bandwidth-constrained environments. My interests include convex optimization, scientific machine learning applications, computer vision, compression, and computational physics.
